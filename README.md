## 🚀 About Me

I’m a computing undergraduate specializing in Data Science with strong hands-on experience in building full-stack web applications using the MERN stack.

I focus on writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code while building production-oriented systems rather than tutorial-based projects. I enjoy solving real-world problems through technology and continuously improving my engineering skills.
